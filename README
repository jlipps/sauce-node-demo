This is a demo app which shows how you can use Wd, Vows.js, and Sauce to have really great test coverage.

Take a look at tests.js and raw_tests.js

Run express app before kicking off test suite:
 $ node index.js

To run tests please use vows test runner like so:

Local selenium server:
 $ vows tests.js --local

Sauce OnDemand (make sure Sauce credentials are set in env):
 $ vows tests.js --sauce
